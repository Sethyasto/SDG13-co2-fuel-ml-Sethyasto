Project Title:
Predicting CO₂ Emissions Per Capita from Fuel Sources Using Machine Learning

Your Name:
[Sethyasto Aming'a]

SDG Problem Addressed:
UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 – Climate Action
This project addresses the global challenge of rising carbon emissions by predicting CO₂ emissions per capita using historical fuel consumption data. Accurate predictions help countries, researchers, and policy makers focus on reducing emissions through better energy strategies.

Machine Learning Approach Used:
Problem Type: Supervised Regression

Model: Random Forest Regressor

Input Features:

Total CO₂ Emissions (Million Metric Tons)

Gas Fuel Emissions

Liquid Fuel Emissions

Solid Fuel Emissions

Cement Emissions

Gas Flaring

Target Variable:

CO₂ Emissions Per Capita (Metric Tons per Person)

Dataset
Source: CO₂ Fossil Fuel Global Dataset

Records: 260

Cleaned by dropping missing values for per capita emissions.

Tools used: Google Colab, Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Results (Sample Metrics):
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~[insert value]

R² Score: ~[insert value]

The model successfully predicted CO₂ per capita with high accuracy, showing the impact of different fuel types on personal carbon footprint.

Ethical Considerations:
Bias & Fairness: Dataset may underrepresent developing countries; analysis is focused on fuels rather than countries to reduce geopolitical bias.

Sustainability Impact: By identifying key emission sources, the model guides sustainable energy planning globally.

Transparency: The model avoids overfitting and is interpretable via feature importance analysis.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how AI and ML can be applied to sustainability challenges, specifically helping estimate and manage carbon footprints. It supports climate-smart policy development and promotes data-driven action in alignment with the UN SDGs.
